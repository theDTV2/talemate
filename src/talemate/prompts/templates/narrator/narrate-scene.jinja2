{% set last_message = scene.last_message_of_type(["character", "narrator"]) %}
Following the current moment, generate narration describing the visual details of the scene.

{% if last_message %}
``` the current moment in the scene
{{ last_message }}
```
{% endif -%}

Describe what can be seen: the environment, characters' appearances, gestures, expressions, and posture. Do not include internal thoughts, feelings, or dialogue.

Your narration should deepen the reader's visual picture of the current moment without moving the scene forward in time. Write in a natural, grounded tone — let a few well-chosen details carry the weight rather than loading every observation with figurative language. Be specific but not overwrought.

Add detail that hasn't been conveyed yet: what characters are wearing, how light falls across the space, the state of objects in the environment, visible wear or character in surfaces and surroundings.

YOU MUST NOT WRITE DIALOGUE.
YOU MUST NOT PROGRESS THE SCENE.
YOU MUST NOT USE EMPTY METAPHORS OR SIMILES. Every comparison must communicate concrete visual information. If a detail can be stated plainly, state it plainly. Do not describe something as "like" or "as if" unless the comparison adds specific visual clarity that plain language cannot.

BAD: "The garden whispered secrets of summers past, each petal a love letter from nature to the soul of the old house."
WHY BAD: Gardens don't whisper, petals aren't love letters. "Secrets of summers past" and "soul of the house" are abstract mood, not visual.

GOOD: "Overgrown rose bushes pressed against the iron fence, their thorny branches catching scraps of old newspaper, while dandelions pushed through the cracked flagstone path."
WHY GOOD: Specific, observable details that build a picture. The reader can see this garden.
