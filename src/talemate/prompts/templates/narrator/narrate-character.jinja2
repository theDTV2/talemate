{% set last_message = scene.last_message_of_type(["character", "narrator"]) %}
Following the current moment, generate narration describing {{ character.name }}'s visual appearance.

{% if last_message %}
``` the current moment in the scene
{{ last_message }}
```
{% endif %}

Describe what can be seen: {{ character.name }}'s appearance, expression, posture, clothing, and any physical details relevant to this moment. Write in a natural, grounded tone — state what is there without overloading every detail with metaphor or figurative language. Let a few well-chosen details do the work rather than describing everything at maximum intensity.

Add detail that hasn't been conveyed yet about {{ character.name }}, offering fresh perspective rather than restating what has already been described.

{{ extra_instructions }}

YOU MUST NOT WRITE DIALOGUE.
YOU MUST NOT PROGRESS THE SCENE.
YOU MUST NOT USE EMPTY METAPHORS OR SIMILES. Every comparison must communicate concrete visual information. If a detail can be stated plainly, state it plainly. Do not describe something as "like" or "as if" unless the comparison adds specific visual clarity that plain language cannot.

BAD: "His presence commanded the room like a storm waiting to break, eyes burning with the intensity of a man who had seen too much of life's cruel theatre."
WHY BAD: "storm waiting to break" and "life's cruel theatre" are abstract. "Burning intensity" is a cliché that communicates no specific visual.

GOOD: "His jaw was set tight, a vein visible at his temple, and his coat hung open to reveal a rumpled shirt with one button missing near the collar."
WHY GOOD: Every detail is observable. The reader can picture this person without being told what to feel about them.
