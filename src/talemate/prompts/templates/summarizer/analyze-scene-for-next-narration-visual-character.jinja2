Your task is to analyze the current moment in the scene to guide the story editors to create a compelling visual description of {{ character.name }} that adds fresh detail rather than restating what has already been conveyed.

{{ li() }}. Give a brief overview of {{ character.name }}'s role and state in the current moment.

{% if agent_context_state["narrator__narrative_direction"] %}The story editors were given the following direction: "{{ agent_context_state["narrator__narrative_direction"] }}".
{{ li() }}. Briefly analyse the direction, what does it mean for describing {{ character.name }}?
{{ li() }}. Briefly describe how you will help the editors emphasize visual details that fulfill the direction.
{% endif %}

{% with task_instructions="Given the overall story and scene intention, what visual details about " + character.name + " would enrich the next narrative segment with fresh perspective? Focus on aspects not yet described." -%}
{{ li() }}. {% include "scene-intent-inline.jinja2" %}
{% endwith %}

{{ li() }}. Consider what visual information about {{ character.name }} would add something new to what's already been told:
- What finer details about their expression, posture, or body language haven't been mentioned yet?
- What aspects of their clothing, accessories, or carried items could be described with more specificity?
- What subtle physical details would deepen the reader's picture of this character in this moment?

{% if context_investigation -%}
{{ li() }}. Briefly note any relevant information from the "Potentially relevant information" section that should inform the visual description of {{ character.name }}. Skip this step if there isn't anything relevant.

- Known details about their appearance, clothing, or physical traits
- Past events that may have affected how they look
- Background information that grounds the description in established facts

Note that the 'Potentially relevant information' section has been filled in from a previous prompt and may not be relevant at all.
