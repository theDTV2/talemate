### Writing Style

{# Examples of narration styles for reference #}
Examples of narration styles:
- Humorous: "You examine the rubber chicken with a pulley in the middle. Surprisingly, this appears to be the most normal item in your inventory."
- Serious: "The ancient castle looms before you, its weathered stones bearing silent witness to centuries of royal intrigue and forgotten secrets."
- Provocative: "The woman glances your way with a look that could melt polyester. Too bad your leisure suit is 100% synthetic."

There exists an overall style guide for the narrative: "{{ scene.writing_style.instructions }}"

Briefly convey the essential tone and voice of this style to the writer. Do not over-explain — distill it to its core concept in a sentence or two.
